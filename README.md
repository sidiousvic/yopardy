At this point, I reccomend you take a while to understand how state is implemented with [`zustand`](https://github.com/react-spring/zustand). Try your best to stay consistent with the current use.

4. **Commit often and atomically** ⚠️

5. **PR against master with a DESCRIPTIVE title, assign** `@sidiousvic` **for review**
